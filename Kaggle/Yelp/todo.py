#todo timers to evaluate

#todo libraries
#use of pretrained neural networks. It implies a given image resolution
# -> do we have a specific network for a given type of image ?
# Caffe, Keras, Lasagne, mxnet
# features come  from last fully connected layer in the Inception net (pretrained from mxnet)


# todo mxnet
# list of model model.FeedForward (which one to use ?)


#todo what is ?

#business feature -> mean of images ? mean of images after clustering  ?
# is this to get a mean value of given features. ?
#Build a feature set for each business by taking the mean of features of all the images
# that belong to the business. Build 9 binary classification models (one for each label)
# using XGBoost. Use the results from this in the final ensemble.

#deep just to get features, then ML on it ?

# softmax layer

#gboost ?


#do I have GPU
